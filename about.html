        <p class="hi">My story</p>
        <p class="content">
          I'm Siyi Gao! I'm currently a junior-year student in NanoEngineering at UCSD. I'm from Chengdu, a city in south China, 
          where is the birthplace of hotpot. People in Chengdu play magic with all kinds of peppers, especially the spicy ones. For this reason, I found it's pretty hard to 
          find the truly spicy and tasty restaurant in America. Personally, I feel pepper could reveal part of my life philosophy. Since there are plenty of pepper in the world,
          it could be spice in a course, the main ingredients, or just a raw pepper. The destiny of pepper are closely related to the people who pick it up and put it in the pan.
          The pepper can dance with extraordinary imaginations or lay on the plate with dead silence. Don't worry, if you got fuzzled by my rhetoric! I mean pepper is just like 
          the life, it will surprize if you treat it with passion and imagination, but it can also put you down easily, if you care nothing about it. Life is about 
          combination, just like pepper needs the boiling oil to release the energy on the plate.

       <p class="content">I kept seeking the possibilities in my life. From my childhood, I developed my interests in sketching. I believed sitting in front of the paper is the best 
        time for me excape into another world, where I can show off whatever I got and never limit my energy. Becoming a drawer as I grow up was my first life goal at that time.
        Okay, life is more capricious than what I believed. As I entered middle school, my day was gradually taken up by those concepts, equations, and homework. some times I got 
        upset about I can't sketch whenever I wanted to, but I was getting used to another life mode smoothly. While I was facing those science concepts on my book, I knew I can't 
        stay with my sketch paper all day anymore, but I didn't feel it's too bad to work with those calculations either. Here was where I started to combine my hobby and acdemic work.
        I'm interested in add artistic element to engineering project, which was a best compromise for both the way I'm now living with and I do feel the combination was chance 
        that giving me space and time for both my hobby and academic achievement.</p>
